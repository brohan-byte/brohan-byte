## Hello there, I'm Rohan 👋
I'm a Computer Science student with strong interests in **computer architecture**, **computer graphics**, and **quantum computing**.  
I enjoy working close to the hardware, understanding how systems execute programs, and building efficient computational pipelines.


## Interests
- 🖥 **Computer Architecture** — CPU execution models, low-level performance, emulation
- 🎨 **Computer Graphics** — rendering pipelines, ray tracing, geometric computation
- ⚛️ **Quantum Computing** — quantum algorithms, simulation, and error modeling

## Featured Projects

- 🔹 **CHIP-8 Emulator**  
  A virtual machine implementation focused on instruction decoding, memory layout, and fetch–decode–execute cycles.

- 🔹 **Real-Time Weather Prediction Pipeline**  
  Streaming system using **Kafka** and **Spark ML** to process data efficiently and perform real-time inference.

- 🔹 **News Trend Analysis**  
  Automated news scraping with **Selenium**, NLP analysis using **NLTK**, and trend visualization with **Matplotlib**.

## Currently Learning
- Rendering pipelines
- Quantum algorithms and simulation frameworks
